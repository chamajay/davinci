                <p>
                    His early years were spent living on his father’s family estate in Vinci. During this period of his life, he was also
                    influenced by his uncle, who had a love of nature and had a hand in rearing him during his formative years.
                    Beyond basic reading, writing and mathematical skills, da Vinci did not receive much of a formal education. Recognizing
                    his potential as an artist, his father sent him at the age of 14 or 15 to apprentice with sculptor and painter Andrea
                    del Verrocchio of Florence.
                    He spent six years honing his technical skills, including metalworking, leather arts, carpentry, drawing and sculpting,
                    and became member of the Guild of Saint Luke by the age of 20. His whereabouts went undocumented for a few years after
                    being accused and acquitted of sodomy in Florence when he was 22.

                <h1>Inventions</h1>
                <p>
                    Within Da Vinci's huge collection of drawings are a number of innovative inventions which would later become reality.
                    This inventive mind combined his p assion for engineering with renowned technical skills as a draughtsman to work as a
                    consultant and designer on multiple projects.There were clear themes to his work in this genre, covering flying
                    machines, war machines, water and land machines plus an assortment of everyday, practical innovations.
                    The "Renaissance Man" also contributed significantly to science, mathematics, sculpture, painting, architecture and
                    drawing. His inventions are a highly memorable segment of his vast career, and also offer clear links to modern day
                    life. His inventive mind went far beyond just being a gifted artist, as many still remember him.

                <h1>Science</h1>
                <p>
                    As an artist, sculptor, and engineer, da Vinci wanted to know not only how the body was constructed and how it worked,
                    but also where the emotions came from and how they were expressed. Da Vinci's most penetrating anatomical studies began
                    in 1506 with his dissection of a 100-year-old man, whose peaceful death he had just witnessed. His meticulous
                    dissections and drawings of muscles,
                    nerves, and vessels reflected the engineer in him, but he struggled to move on from ancient notions of bodily functions,
                    although his painstaking empirical work got him there in the end. He described the coronary sinuses almost 200 years
                    before Valsalva gave them his name, and, 120 years before
                    Harvey, was surely only a heartbeat away from grasping the idea of the circulation of the blood.

                    Da Vinci left Italy for good in 1516, when French ruler Francis I generously offered him the title of “Premier Painter
                    and Engineer and Architect to the King,” which afforded him the opportunity to paint and draw at his leisure while
                    living in a country manor house, the Château of Cloux, near Amboise in France.

                    Although accompanied by Melzi, to whom he would leave his estate, the bitter tone in drafts of some of his
                    correspondence from this period indicate that da Vinci’s final years may not have been very happy ones.
                    <br><br>
                    Da Vinci died at Cloux (now Clos-Lucé) in 1519 at age 67. He was buried nearby in the palace church of Saint-Florentin.
